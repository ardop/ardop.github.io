<h1>ARDOP-Autonomous Robot Development Open-source Platform</h1>
<p>
ARDOP is an open source humanoid robot that would serve as an extensive platform for the development of robotic applications. It is an economical platform that aims to make robots more commonplace. ARDOP could be 3D printed and is designed to be cost effective. The aim is to make a full fledged integrated hardware and software platform so that it can be used for commercial or research purposes to accelerate the growth of robotics. Using ARDOP, students, researchers and consumers will be able to use pre-made algorithms, modify them and execute them with ease. The different abstraction layers in the project enable people with all levels of technical expertise to build and develop algorithms and functionality in the robot.

	The Initial prototype was built to execute a simple manipulation task of picking up a ball and placing it in a cup. The objects could be placed arbitrarily in the workspace and ARDOP is able to effectively detect, localize and manipulate them.
